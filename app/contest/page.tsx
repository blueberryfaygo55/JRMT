                Exciting 60-minute team event with sets of 3 problems where all teams gather in a common space and solve problems at the same time. Each team is initially assigned a set of 3 problems, which they can turn in to volunteer organizers up front when completed and receive the next set of 3 problems, for up to 9 sets (so 27 problems) in total. The last set of problems consists of 3 estimation problems. All answers are single values. Problems are weighted differently based on their difficulty for a total of 400 points. There will be a live scoreboard displaying each team’s progress and placement; thus, teams will receive almost immediate feedback for sets they submitted.

            Within a round (Speed/Accuracy/Team/Guts), ties are broken by the last problem solved by the individuals/teams. If a tie persists, we consider the second last problem solved, and so on. If the individuals/teams in consideration solve the same set of problems, a tie will be declared.

If two teams have the same total score, ties will be broken by their score on the Team Round. If a tie persists, ties are broken by their score on the Guts Round. If a tie persists, ties are broken by their highest-scoring members.
